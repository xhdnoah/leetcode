In most programming competitions, we are required to answer the result in 10^9+7 modulo. The reason behind this is, if problem constraints are large integers, only efficient algorithms can solve them in an allowed limited time.

### What is modulo operation

The remainder obtained after the division operation on two operands is known as modulo operation. The operator for doing modulus operation is '%'. For example: a % b = c which means, when a is divided by b it gives the remainder c, 7%2 = 1, 17%3 = 2.

### 为什么是 1000000007
- 1000000007 是质数，对质数取余能避免冲突
- int32位的最大值为2147483647，所以对于int32位来说1000000007足够大
- int64位(long)的最大值为2^63-1，对于1000000007来说它的平方不会在int64中溢出。所以在大数相乘的时候，因为(a∗b)%c=((a%c)∗(b%c))%c，所以相乘时两边都对1000000007取模，再保存在int64里面不会溢出
